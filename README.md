# Django Blog
A simple project developed in Django, a high level Python Web Framework. It is a simple blog, in which users can publish their own posts, write comments in other posts. Moreover, posts can be classified into categories and tags. It also has an API REST built in Json. The main goal of this project was to learn Python and Django, because both of them were needed to develop Django apps for AGBO Training.
