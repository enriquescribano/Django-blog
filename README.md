# Django Blog
A simple project developed in Django. 

It is a simple blog, in which users can publish their own posts, write comments in other posts. 
Moreover, posts can be classified into categories and tags. It also has a JSON API REST. 

The main goal of this project was to learn Python and Django on my own.
